# Responsive Templates

This project contains a set of templates that I find to be quite useful in
expediting the process of builing responsive websites.

## Patterns Included
1. Column Drop
2. Mostly Fluid
3. Layout Shifter
4. Off Canvas

## Credits
The templates for the first three patterns are my original works, but were
inspired by Udacity's Responsive Web Design Fundamentals course. The template
for the final pattern, Off Canvas, is actually a modified version of Udacity's
code from the course.
